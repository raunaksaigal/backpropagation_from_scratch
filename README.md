# Backpropagation (From scratch)


A backpropagation algorithm developed from scratch. Based on numpy, pandas and matplotlib for accuracy metrics.

## How to download

To download and install the follow the steps below. You may create a virtual environment prior to module installation. 


```
git clone https://github.com/raunaksaigal/backpropagation_from_scratch.git
cd backpropagation_from_scratch
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter-lab .

```

## Changing accordingly

To experiment with hidden layers and change the existing or add new hidden layers, change the parameters of cell 15

- lr - Learning rate
- nepochs - Number of epochs
- random_selection - put the desired value for random splitting of the dataset
- random_wb - initializing random values for weights and biases


## Problems and Improvements

The backpropagation is very slow to run and for 20 epochs it takes about a minute or so for my i5 10th gen CPU. Please help in improving the results by contributing. Every contribution, even minor ones, are invaluable!
